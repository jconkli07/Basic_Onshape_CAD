## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome. It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering. After doing this assignment, I felt pretty comfortable with extruding and cutting holes in objects, whereas at the beginning I had some trouble with it.

## Mount

### Description

For the mount I created a square plate (120mm x 120mm) with 4 smaller holes in the corners (10mm). I used a linear pattern to make the holes identical. Then we put a circle in the direct center that was 25mm wide and extruded it.

### Reflection

In the first assignment I had a some trouble creating a linear pattern, but because I worked through it I was able to do it easily this time. Only one direction on a linear pattern makes it just a straight line, if you want it to be something else (like a square for this assignment) you have to add another direction. I also learned the "p" toggles whether the planes are hidden or not.

## Fork

### Description
 
In this assignment I created a circle 80 mm wide and extruded it. Then I added two rectangles off of it and cut a hole 10 mm wide through the center of them. Then I added a tube 5 mm wide off of the other side of the cylinder and extruded it 60 mm. Then I used the fillet tool on all of the sharp edges to soften it up and I added a "skirt" to the joining between the cylinder and the rectangles.

### Reflection

This assignment really helped me get good at making sketches on other objects. I learned that when you are cutting a hole and you make it "through all" it cuts through all things in its way, even if those things aren't touching the object that it's sketched on. Tangent propogation allows you to create a skirt with the fillet tools.
